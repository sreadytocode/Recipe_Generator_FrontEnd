## Capstone project

### Introduction

This is the culmination of all that we learned while studying professional software developemnt with CodeClan. The main goals of this application was intended to make meal times easier for families while also trying to reduce food waste. The application was build in a two week time frame with six software development students working together to design and build the application. The app uses the following technologies:

* HTML, Taliwind CSS, JavaScript and React on the front end of the application
* Java, Spring Boot, H2 SQL (relational-database) on the backend to build the API and serve the data needed to load the application.
